Protein-glycan example derived from PDB ID 1LMQ in which the default HADDOCK 2.4 procedure (`unbound_vdw_na_default.cfg`) is compared with two new, HADDOCK 3.0-specific protocols, in which rmsd (`unbound_vdw_na_clustrmsd.cfg`) and ilrmsd (`unbound_vdw_na_clustilrmsd.cfg`) clustering are performed after the rigid-body docking stage.
